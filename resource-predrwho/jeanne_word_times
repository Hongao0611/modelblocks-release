word time
Already? 0.31
Was 1.04
it 1.22
2012? 1.37
2013. null
Yeah. 2.76
Yeah. 3.44
In 3.7199999999999998
the 3.78
spring. 3.87
But 4.34
then, 4.5
I 5.24
don't 5.33
know, 5.45
we 5.84
got 7.12
to 7.34
know 7.4
each 7.53
other 7.65
very 8.099999
quickly, 8.309999
and 8.929999
I 11.099999
just 11.28
felt 11.53
like 11.82
from 12.009999
the 12.16
beginning 12.25
that 13
you 14
were 15.07
very 15.299999
easy 15.679999
to 15.96
connect 16.09
with. 16.5
Like 17.709999
I 17.93
remember 17.959999
early 18.27
on, 18.59
like 18.81
our 18.91
conversations 19.01
were 19.85
like 19.98
already 20.17
emotionally 20.45
laden 20.88
and 21.22
like 21.39
and 21.759999999999998
I 21.88
know 21.92
full 22.17
of, 22.5
like, 23.07
it 23.56
was 23.68
easy 23.86
to 25.21
get 25.35
into 25.509999999999998
like 25.77
deeper 25.92
things, 26.21
you 26.79
know, 26.939999999999998
very 27.15
quickly, 27.469999
even 28.130000000000003
though 28.34
we 28.439999999999998
hadn't 28.52
known 28.75
each 28.9
other 29.02
very 29.189999999999998
long. 29.389999
I 30.53
remember 30.740000000000002
the 30.98
first 31.08
time 31.299999
I 31.740000000000002
saw 31.92
you, 32.13
we 32.15
were 32.799999
in 33.2
the 33.4
house 33.49
and 34.59
you 35.219999
were 35.35
talking 35.519999999999996
to 35.989999999999995
one 36.139999
of 36.299999
the 36.4
seniors 36.49
and 36.9
I 36.97
don't 37.06
remember 37.22
who 37.71
it 37.84
was, 37.94
but 38.85
you 38.89
just 39.05
knew 39.19
what 39.35
you 39.44
were 39.51
doing 39.63
and 40.01
you 40.12
seemed 40.21
so 40.42
happy 40.58
and 40.99
I 41.13
felt 41.22
so 41.49
insecure 42.14
in 42.66
that 42.769999999999996
moment 42.94
because 43.38
that 43.57
interviewing 43.76
process 44.26
was 44.74
weird. 44.88
Yeah. 45.49
It 45.94
was 45.969999
a null
weird 46.03
situation. 46.29
I 47.12
think 47.259999
that's 47.44
so 47.58
great. 47.91
And 48.219999
you've 48.349999
said 48.5
this 48.679999
to 48.809999
me, 48.95
but 49.009999
like, 49.66
I 49.88
felt 50.36
the 50.549999
exact 50.61
same 50.929999
way, 51.139999
like 51.4
I... 51.88
talking 53.129999
to 53.43
people 53.489999999999995
and 53.889999
I 54.43
remember 54.57
feeling 54.79
really 55.11
insecure 55.379999
in 55.58
that 55.68
process. 55.8
At 56.5
the 56.65
same 56.72
time, 56.94
like, 57.27
you 57.63
seemed 57.94
really 58.16
confident. 58.35
Yeah, 58.980000000000004
I 60.1
don't 60.18
know. 60.31
Yeah. 61.66
I 63.09
guess, 63.2
well 64.12
what's 64.27
also 64.41
weird 64.66
now 65.48
is 65.88
to 66.02
think 66.13
that 66.32
we 66.45
are 66.639999
in 66.69
the 66.78999999999999
position 66.88
that 68.17
the 68.969999
seniors 69.07
were 69.429999
when 69.559999
we 69.759999
were 69.87
first 70.02
years, 70.359999
and 70.98
we 71.129999
seem 71.24
that 71.48
way 71.66
to 72.529999
the 72.65
younger 72.73
people. 73.03
I 73.71
forget 73.82
that 74.13
sometimes, 74.26
because 74.9
like 75.07
to 75.41
me, 75.55
like 75.91
they 77.11
seem 77.28
like 77.48
equals. 77.63
But 78.06
then 78.15
I 78.26
remember 78.35
in 78.96
a 79.12
lot 79.18
of 79.43
ways 79.55
I 79.83
think 79.88
they 80.059999
look 80.17
up 80.32
to 80.45
us. 80.57
They 81.389999
do. 81.53999999999999
Do 82.01
you 82.12
remember 82.17
when 82.389999
I 82.5
was 82.55
so 82.639999
offended 82.77
that 83.179999
one 83.42
girl 83.65
just 83.9
didn't 84.05
even 84.25
think 84.929999
to 85.15
invite 85.27
me 85.599999
to 85.92
something? 86.09
And 86.49
I 86.589999
felt 86.69
like, 86.92
oh, 87.099999
well, 87.5
clearly 87.759999
she 88.09
doesn't 88.209999
feel 88.459999
close 88.559999
to 88.799999
me, 88.91
but 89.1
she 89.629999
didn't 89.77
realize 89.85
I 90.24
want 90.6
to 90.85
come. 90.97
Yeah. 91.46
No. 92.12
And 92.92
also 93.07
I'm 93.33
never 93.5
really 93.75
one 94.01
to, 94.28
like, 94.42
initiate, 95.6
I 97.1
don't null
want 97.24
to 97.36
say 97.39
contact, 97.54
but 98.139999
like 98.76
reach 98.94
out 99.09
to 99.22
people. 99.27
Like 100.05
sometimes 100.08
I 100.469999
sort 100.55
of 100.719999
wait 100.82
for 100.98
people 101
to 101.219999
reach 101.32
out 101.44
to 101.59
me. 101.679999
So 101.98
then 102.469999
yeah, 102.799999
I 103.049999
get 103.15
confused 103.32
when 103.95
someone 104.139999
like 104.52
younger 104.69
doesn't 105.24
reach 105.509999
out 105.66
to 105.82
me. 105.889999
And 106
then 106.09
I 106.18
realize 106.24
maybe 106.799999
there 108.109999
is 108.24
this 108.35
power 108.51
dynamic 108.73
that 109.129999
I'm 109.25
not, 109.39
you 109.82
know, 109.95
picking 110.15
up 110.51
on. 110.6
No, 111.09
for 111.24
sure. 111.38
For 112.17
sure. 112.31
And 113.59
I 113.77
wonder 113.84
when 114.14
that 114.31
starts 114.48
leveling 114.79
out 115.14
too, 115.35
if 115.57
that's 115.69
something 115.86
that 116.24
as 116.33
soon 116.45
as 116.63
you're 116.74
outside 116.86
of 117.21000000000001
college, 117.34
things 118.13
just 118.4
kind 118.58
of... 118.809999
everyone... 119.78
Yeah, 120.78999999999999
I 121.24
don't 121.299999
know, 121.429999
I 121.549999
wonder 121.639999
if 121.86
people 121.96000000000001
ever 122.179999
feel 122.37
that 122.589999
with 122.74
like 122.88
careers, 123.02
too. 123.44
Yeah. 124.309999
Especially 125.289999
in 125.629999
those 125.719999
huge 125.889999
corporations. 126.16
But 126.96
it's 127.09
like, 127.24
if 127.55
you're 127.73
actually 127.86
friends 128.14
with 128.35
your 128.46
coworkers 128.55
and 129.66
if 129.76
they're 129.87
the 130.01
same 130.12
age, 130.37
is 130.91
it 131.04
fine? 131.23
But 132
what 132.81
if 132.96
your 133.05
boss 133.14
is 133.42
younger 133.54
than 133.83
you? 133.95
How 134.11
does 134.26
that 134.389999
work 134.54
out? 134.72
How 134.88
does... 135.01
I 135.77
think null
there's null
a 136.09
lot 136.15
to 136.41
do 136.52
with 136.54
personalities, 136.62
too. 137.34
Yeah. 137.79
Yeah. 138.53
I 138.98
think 139.07
certain 139.309999
personalities 139.57
are, 140.2
I 141.04999999999998
don't 141.05999999999997
know, 141.219999
will 141.53
always 141.66
come 141.929999
off 142.07999999999998
a 142.190001
bit 142.24
stronger 142.389999
and 142.84
like, 142.99
yeah. 143.89000000000001
Are 146.11
you 146.21
excited 146.29
to 146.59
go 146.66
home? 146.8
I'm 147.43
so 147.73
excited. 148.15
I'm 148.94
leaving 149.08
tomorrow. 149.31
Oh 150.43
my 150.44
gosh. 150.46
But 150.76
I 151.21
like 151.33
totally 151.58
forgot 151.92
that 152.42
I 152.57
was 152.62
leaving 152.78
and 153.11
so 153.24
I 153.33
haven't 153.41
packed 153.65
yet. 153.929999
Oh, 154.67
that's 154.84
why 155.01
you 155.11
had 155.219999
your 155.3
suitcase 155.41
out! 155.86
Yep. 156.27
Oh, 156.599999
my 156.849999
gosh. 156.99
I 157.53
for 157.65
some 157.78
reason 157.92
thought 158.16
that 158.309999
was 158.44
from 158.57
fall 158.71
break 158.91
or 159.17
something. 159.23
No. 159.73
I 160.629999
know, 160.74
I'm 160.940001
packing 161.09
and 161.59
I'm 161.82999999999998
really 161.98
excited 162.19
because 162.54
I'm 162.95
bringing 163.13
Jane 163.42000000000002
home 163.64
with 163.89
me. 164.05
Yeah. 164.12
So 164.95
that's 165.43
exciting. 165.63
I'm 166.5
nervous, 166.7
though, 167.06
in 167.64
some 167.79
ways. 167.99
Like, 168.66
she's 168.85
met 169.03
my 169.15
mom, 169.26
my 169.6
dad 169.76
and 170.04
my 170.17
sister, 170.27
but 170.67
she 170.87
hasn't 171.02
met 171.309999
Tommy, 171.98
my 172.86
brother. 172.969999
Oh, 173.179999
Tommy. 173.75
And 174.57
he 174.719999
is... 175.5
he's 176.66
a 177.059999
very 177.12
strong 177.49
personality. 177.87
So 180.33
I 180.78
think 180.89
it's 181.09
going 181.2
to 181.33
be... 181.369999
and 181.51
she 181.83
has 182.02
a 182.12
strong 182.19
personality. 182.4
So 183.35
them 183.49
coming 183.7
together, 183.97
I'm 184.51
like, 184.61
I 185.77
don't null
know, 185.9
a 186.72
little 186.83
nervous. 187.19
She's 187.97
going 188.2
to 188.27
be 188.44
more 188.559999
polite, 188.72
though, 189.429999
because 189.74
she... 190.36
I 191.01
don't 191.09
know, 191.19
I 191.29
think 191.429999
she'll 191.63
be 191.77
more 191.889999
intimidated 192.009999
by 192.44
the 192.54
fact 192.66
that 192.92
she's 193.04
in 193.37
your 193.929999
home 194.11
setting. 194.4
Yeah. 194.849999
But 195.36
I 195.509999
wonder 195.559999
if 195.82
he'll 196.09
be 196.199999
the 196.299999
same 196.41
way 196.639999
if 196.85
he 197.109999
gets 197.35
aggravated 198.139999
by 198.76
her 198.959999
in 199.13
certain 199.28
situations. 199.53
I 200.2
also 200.35
feel 200.72
like, 200.99
though, 201.28
that 201.45
they 201.62
have 201.92
a 202.73
lot 202.9
of 203.08
similar 203.21
opinions, 203.56
so 204.31
it 204.33
might, 205.96
I 206.25
don't 206.309999
know, 206.45
it null
might 206.65
work 206.8
out 206.96
well. 207.08
If 207.24
anything, 207.34
they 207.8
might 207.889999
gang 208.08
up 208.24
on 208.38
me. 208.53
Oh, 209.05
no! 209.15
Yeah, 211.559999
exactly. null
That's 211.83
funny. 211.87
Has 214.67000000000002
she 214.74
ever 214.84
been 215.01
to 215.17000000000002
California? 215.27
Once, 216.559999
when 217.189999
she 217.34
was 217.449999
younger. null
So 218.2
not 218.36
really. 218.55
No, 219.01
not 219.51
really. 219.68
Wait, 220.44
what 220.72
are 220.82
you 220.89
doing? 220.97
I 222.05
am 222.46
staying 222.61
here 222.88
and 223.99
just 224.559999
hanging 224.65
out, 224.92
and 225.62
then 225.86
I'm 226.179999
going 226.38
to 226.63
my 226.78
friend 226.889999
Katherine's 227.09
house. 227.469999
So 228.45
all 228.63
we 228.809999
ever... 228.95
Yeah, 229.389999
it 229.57
feels 229.67
like 229.889999
one 230.02
big 230.16
interview. 230.309999
I 230.65
remember 230.74
for 231.12
Katherine's 231.42
graduation 231.88
party, 232.359999
well, 232.92000000000002
we 233.02
get 233.16
there 233.42000000000002
and 233.789999
there's 233.9
a 234.029999
catering 234.109999
service, 234.619999
like 235.64
someone 235.78
asking 236.07
me 236.36
if 236.49
I 236.59
need 236.66
valet 236.84
parking, 237.14
like, 237.95
aren't 238.67
we 238.9
in 239.05
a 239.14
neighborhood? 239.21
And, 242.41
yeah, 242.98
the 243.48
whole 243.67
gathering 244.38
was 244.87
a 245.02
networking 245.08
event, 246.25
which 246.88
I 247.2
didn't 247.28
like. 247.469999
I'm 247.83
not 247.98
prepared 248.13
for 248.57
those 248.679999
situations. 248.83
But 250.24
I 250.379999
think 250.43
this 250.6
one 250.73
would 250.85
be 250.949999
more 251.09
relaxed. 251.219999
Which 252.51
is 252.539999
good. 252.559999
Are 252.969999
you 253.059999
going 253.13
to 253.26
see 253.34
Olivia's 253.72
family? 254.03
I 255.03
might, 255.2
I 255.65
want 255.77
to. 256.12
I 256.97
want 257.08
to. 257.37
I 257.72
don't 257.82
know. 257.99
It'll 258.8
be 258.9
hard. 259
I 259.21
think 259.27
they 259.43
want 259.52
to 259.66
spend 259.74
more 259.89
time 260.01
with 260.47
the 260.71
younger 260.78
brother. 261.04
I 261.77
wish 261.83
I 261.98
could. 262.059999
Have 262.74
you 262.88
been 262.96
talking 263.099999
to 263.349999
Olivia? 263.46
How 264.33
is 264.46
she? 264.58
She 265.4
wants 265.53
to 265.65
be null
a 265.88
midwife, 265.889999
and 266.63
she 268.58
realized 268.71999999999997
that 269.05
she 269.809999
doesn't 269.959999
really 270.18
have 270.35
to 270.49
have 270.56
a 270.67
career 270.73
that 271.02
proves 271.19
anything 271.46
to 272.24
anyone 272.31
else, 272.58
but 272.8
she 273.22
needs 273.32
to 273.46
do 273.53
something 273.64
that 273.87
fulfills 274.01
her. 274.45
I 274.92
like 275.01
that 275.18
idea. 275.3
I 275.63
can 275.74
also 275.92
see 276.21
her 276.43
being 276.79
a 276.99
midwife, 277.05
like 277.57
much 278.05
more 278.25
than 278.38
a 278.52
doctor. 278.57
Oh, 279.15
absolutely. 279.28
She 280.42
can't 280.59
do 280.82
surgery. 280.929999
Her 282.69
hands 282.809999
shake 283.12
holding 283.38
coffee. 283.67
Yeah. 284.25
Yeah, 286.199999
no, 286.43
she's 286.57
super 286.779999
happy, 287.02
though. 287.289999
She's 287.639999
also 287.85
just 288.109999
one 288.32
of 288.4
the 288.46
most 288.55
soothing 288.76
people 289.17
I 289.49
know. 289.56
And null
I null
feel null
like null
as null
a 290.59
midwife 290.61
like 291.1
you 291.23
would 291.32
need 291.47
to 291.76
have 291.84
that. 292.07
Oh 292.48
yeah. 292.6
For 292.89
people. 293.04
Oh 293.67
yeah. 293.77
Yeah. 294.42
Especially 294.84
since 295.2
most 295.43
people 295.58
who 295.81
choose 295.92
to 296.16
have 296.179999
a 296.28
midwife 296.33
don't 297.09
have 297.349999
an 297.469999
epidural. 297.559999
So 298.429999
you 299.309999
need 299.46
someone 299.679999
who's 300.04
calming! 300.2
